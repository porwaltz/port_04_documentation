                What is chess
            </header>
            
            <p>
                Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. 
                It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. 
                The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe during the second half of the 15th century 
                after evolving from similar, much older games of Indian and Persian origin. 
                Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, played by millions of people worldwide at home, 
                in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. 
                It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. 
                At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) 
                controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. 
                The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, 
                whereby the king is under immediate attack (in "check") and there is no way to remove it from attack on the next move. 
                There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.

            </header>
            <p>
                One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create a chess-playing machine. 
                In 1997, Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in a match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. 
                Today's chess engines are significantly stronger than even the best human players, 
                and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.

                How to win?
            </header>
            <p>
                there are several ways to win a match:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>By doing checkmate</li>
                <li>By withdraw</li>
                <li>By lack of your adversary's time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When a king is under immediate attack by one or two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. 
                A move in response to a check is legal only if it results in a position where the king is no longer in check. 
                This can involve capturing the checking piece; 
                interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king 
                (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); 
                or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. 
                Castling is not a permissible response to a check.
            </p>
            <p>
                The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; 
                this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. 
                It is never legal for a player to make a move that puts or leaves the player's own king in check. In casual games, 
                it is common to announce "check" when putting the opponent's king in check, 
                but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments.

                Draw game
            </header>
            <p>
                If the player to move has no legal moves, but is not in check, the position is a stalemate, and the game is drawn.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the game reaches a dead position, in which neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves, the game is drawn. 
                For example, if only the kings are on the board, 
                all other pieces having been captured, checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the other hand, if both players still have a knight there is a highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate, so this rule does not apply. 
                This rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to "insufficient material", 
                extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns cannot be attacked.

            <ul>
                <li>Casting: consists of moving the king two squares along the first rank toward a rook on the player's first rank, 
                    and then placing the rook on the last square that the king crossed.</li>
                <li>En passant: When a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position 
                    and there is an opponent's pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file, 
                    then the opponent's pawn can capture it en passant ("in passing"), 
                    moving to the square the pawn passed over.</li>
                <li>Promotion: When a pawn advances to the eighth rank, as a part of the move it is promoted 
                    and must be exchanged for the player's choice of queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color</li>

                Time control
            </header>
            <p>
                In competition, chess games are played with a time control. If a player's time runs out before the game is completed, 
                the game is automatically lost (provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate). 
                The duration of a game ranges from long (or "classical") games, 
                which can take up to seven hours (even longer if adjournments are permitted), to bullet chess (under 3 minutes per player for the entire game). 
                Intermediate between these are rapid chess games, 
                lasting between 20 minutes and two hours per game, a popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time is controlled using a chess clock that has two displays, one for each player's remaining time. 
                Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks, which allow for time controls with increments.
